When there is order within each set, we recommend you to do all three sets of tasks simultaneously instead of one by one.\n\nA. Stacking\n\tA1. Think twice before you place your block. If your first decision doesn’t seem to fit well, think again.\n\tA2. Keep your terrain flat since it allows more possibilities for different blocks.\n\tA3. When hold allowed, thinking more about sequences to arrange the pieces in your hand, the held one, plus the previews. In order to have flat terrain for longer time.\n\nB. Efficiency & Speed\n\tB1. Don’t count on ghost pieces. Think, with your brain, where this piece would land and what keys you should press. Do it only when you are ready.\n\tB2. Use both of the rotation keys. Don’t just use one and press it many times when you can press the other one just once.\n\tB3. Don’t worry too much about your speed when you start learning Finesse. Keep your move accurate, and then it is not hard to improve your speed once you have mastered it.\n\nC. Stacking\n\tC1. Stably finish 40L without topping out.\n\tC2. Stably finish 40L with no Hold without topping out.\n\tC3. Stably finish 40L with all Techrashes.\n\tC4. Stably finish 40L with all Techrashes and no Hold.\n\nSet C is more flexible, and you can adjust the difficulties based on your own conditions (like what does “stably” means to you).\n\nWhen you finish all the tasks in set C, keep practicing A1. This is the fundamental skill in any stacker game, and you can master practically any mode when you can just scan through the Next sequence easily.",
